##### Problem Statement :

Drowsiness detection technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving .

##### Objective :
		1.  To build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a personâ€™s eyes are closed.
		2.  This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.
 
 For this we will be using the following components :
		1. Python and Jupyter notebook
		2. OpenCV
		3. Keras 
		4. Tensorflow and pygame
Image Sequence Input:
            
                        1)Face Detection
                        2)Eye Detection
                        3)Eye State Tracking

Output:
   
                         1)If eye closed for n frames
                                               -Yes (Alarm)
                                               -No  (Go to Face Detection)
